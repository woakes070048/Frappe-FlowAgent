"""
DocType event → workflow dispatch.

This module is wired via the `doc_events` wildcard in hooks.py. Every
single doctype save/submit/cancel/etc. flows through `on_event`. To stay
cheap, the dispatcher does an indexed lookup against the
`FlowAgent Workflow Trigger Index` table (which is maintained whenever
a workflow is saved) and bails out immediately if nothing matches.

Verbose mode (controlled by FlowAgent Settings.verbose_logging) writes
every fire/no-fire decision to Frappe's error log so you can tail
`bench logs` and watch dispatch behaviour in real time when debugging.
