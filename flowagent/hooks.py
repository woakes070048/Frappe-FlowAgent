# DocType Events
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The wildcard listener catches every DocType save/submit/cancel and
# dispatches to any FlowAgent Workflow that has a matching trigger
# binding. The dispatcher itself is cheap — it does an indexed lookup
# against Workflow Trigger Index and bails out fast if nothing matches.
